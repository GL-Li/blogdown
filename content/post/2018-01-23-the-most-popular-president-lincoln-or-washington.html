<p>Washington and Lincoln are the two greatest presidents in the history of the United States. This post, however, does not discuss how great they are. Instead, I want to show a fun fact related the two presidents: how many cities and towns (and equivalents) are named after them. I am living in Lincoln, Rhode Island, a town so named in honor of President Lincoln.</p>
<p>The data are extracted from decennial census 2010, the most detailed census so far. There are 311 cities and towns having “Washington” in their names and 205 having “Lincoln”. We also extract the coordinates and population of these cities and towns and plot them on the US map. There are significantly more places named after “Washington” than “Lincoln” in three states, Indiana , Ohio, and Pennsylvania. They combined have 109 more places with <code>Washington</code> than with <code>Lincoln</code>.</p>

<p>Here are the code. We use package <a href="https://github.com/GL-Li/totalcensus"><code>totalcensus</code></a> to extract data from decennial census 2010.</p>
<p>Let’s first load packages.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(totalcensus)
library(data.table)
library(magrittr)
library(ggmap)</code></pre>
<p>Define a function to extract census data of cities and towns including particular words in names.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>get_area &lt;- function(keywords){
    # read census data
    selected &lt;- read_decennial(
        year = 2010,
        states = &quot;US&quot;,
        geo_headers = c(&quot;NAME&quot;),
        show_progress = FALSE
    ) %&gt;%
        # select place and county subdivision that have name in NAME
        .[SUMLEV %in% c(&quot;060&quot;, &quot;160&quot;)] %&gt;%
        .[NAME %like% paste0(keywords, collapse = &quot;|&quot;)] %&gt;%
        # remove duplicates by (lon, lat)
        unique(by = c(&quot;lon&quot;, &quot;lat&quot;))
    
    # add area column to store keywords of area
    for (nm in keywords){
        selected[NAME %like% nm, area := nm]
    }
    
    return(selected)
}</code></pre>
