A R user can benefit a lot from building packages. You don't have to a be R developer to write packages. Developers write packages for others; you can just write packages for yourself. As a R user, you must have written functions and collected datasets, and you may use them across projects or you may want to use them later on. The conventional way to reuse functions is to copy and paste them to the new project or to  load them by `source(xxx.R)`, and the conventional way to reuse datasets it to load `.Rdata` files which store the datasets. You will have to know where the functions and datasets are stored, which is not a easy job if you have a large collection. By building fucntions and datasets into a package, you keep them in one place and use them the same way as using any other packages. With the help of package documentation, these functions and datasets become your great asset.

Building a R packages is actually far more easier than a R user could have expected. In RStudio, it is nothing but writing normal R code with formatted comments. If this package is just for yourself, you can save the hassel of publishing it on github or CRAN.

Below are step by step instructions of building a working package in RStudio. There are many great tutorials for building R packages. I try to make this one to be the simplest and most up to date.  

## Preapare for a new package project

**Step 1 - install necessary packages** Update RStudio if yours is very old. Start RStudio and install package `roxygen2`. This package simplifies package documentation.
```{r}
install.packages("roxygen2")
```

**Step 2 - create a new package** From RStudio menu, click file then new project and choose to create project in a new directory. Select creating R package and name you package, for example, as `mytoolbox` and place it in the directory of your choice. RStudio automatically creates several subdirectories and files.

**Step 3 - allow roxygen2 to take care of documentation** From RStudio menu click build then configure build tools, verify package is selected in Project build tools, check the box for Generate documentation with roxygen, in the popup dialogue box check all boxes. 

**Step 4 - delete NAMESPACE file** to clear way for roxygen2 to automatically generate this file. Otherwise you will get a warning when building the package.



## Add a function to the package

Create a `.R` files for the function and save it in subdirectory `/R`. The best practice is to have only one function in a `.R` file. You can have as many files as needed for all your functions under subdirectory `/R`. 

The `.R` file, let's call it `mess_up_function.R`, has two sections, as shown in the example code below. The first is the Roxygen comment section, of which each line starts with `#'`. Roxygen2 generates documentation of the function from these comments. Most tags in the comment section are self-explainatary,  for example `@para` for parameters and `@examples` for examples. Pay attention to these three tags: 1) `#' @export` exports the function for package users. 2) `#' @import package_name` or `#' @importFrom package_name function_1 function_2` are to import whole packages or selected functions, depending on how you use these packages in building your own package. Import the whole package if you use many functions in the package; import only selected functions if you know you only need them. 

The second section is the R code where you define your function. This section is standard R code with one exception: never use `library(pkg_name)` or `require(pkg_name)` to load packages,  as they may mess up with name space. Instead, use `#' @import` or `#' @importFrom` as discussed in the Roxygen comment section, or use `pkg_name::func()`. The later method takes extra 4 microseconds for each run, which is acceptable for processing small datasets. 

```{r}
#' mess up function (This is the title.)
#' 
#' @description This function mess up with two strings by extracting vowels from
#' the first string and attaching them to the second.
#'
#' @param string_1 the first string
#' @param string_2 the second string
#' 
#' @return a string 
#'
#' @examples
#' # example 1
#' mess_up("The United States", "Russia")
#' 
#' # example 2
#' mess_up("Barack Obama", "Donald Trump")

#' @export
#' 
#' @importFrom stringr str_extract_all


mess_up <- function(string_1, string_2){
    ## This function extract vowels from string_1 and place it 
    ## at the end of string_2
    vowels <- str_extract_all(string_1, "[AEIOUaeiou]")[[1]]
    vowels <- paste0(vowels, collapse = "")
    paste0(string_2, vowels, collapse = "")
}
```


## Add a dataset to the package
### save dataset in subdirectory `/data`
This dataset can be a vector, a list, a dataframe, or a data table. Let's call it `my_dataset`. To add it to the package, simply save it as a `.RData` file to the subdirectory `/data` of the package by running 
```{r}
# one .RData file has ONLY one dataset
save(my_dataset, file = "path_to_package/data/my_dataset.RData")
```

### create a `.R` file in subdirectory `/R` to document the dataset
This dataset is ready to use, but a good practice is always to have a documentation for it. We can make a `doc_my_dataset.R` file for data documentation. The file is almost completely Roxygen comments. The only line of non-comment code is the name of the dataset in quotation `"my_dataset"`. 

```{r}
#' Here is the title of the dataset
#'
#' @description More description of the dataset is here
#'
#' @docType data
#'
#' @usage data("my_dataset")
#'
#' @format data.frame
#'
#' @keywords datasets
#'
#' @source This is a link to 
#' \href{http://www.xxx.xxx.com/xxx.csv}{the origin data}
#'

"my_dataset"
```



## Set up the DESCRIPTION file
This file mostly provides general information of your package. Many of them you may not care if you just write the package for yourself. But two items are important: 1)  If you want to load your dataset whenever loading the package, keep `LazyData: true`. 2) Place all other packages used in your package under `Imports`. In case others want to install your package, these packages will be installed automatically.

```{r eval=FALSE}
Package: my_package_name
Type: Package
Title: Title of package 
Version: 0.1.2
Author: my name
Maintainer: my name <myemail@xxx.com>
Description: Give a little bit more detailed description of the package which can 
    span multiple lines. 
License: your_choice
Encoding: UTF-8
LazyData: true
Imports:
    stringr (>= 1.2.0), 
    ggplot2 (>= 2.0.0)
```


## Build the package
The last step is to build the package, which is very easy in RStudio. From the menu select Build and then Build and Reload. RStudio will take care of all that follow. After you package is successfully built, you can use you package as any other package in your work with `library(mytoolbox)` and enjoy the easy access to your functions and datasets.
