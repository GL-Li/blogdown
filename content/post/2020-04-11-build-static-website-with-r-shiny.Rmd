Sounds stupid? Yes, it's kind of throwing away 99% of Shiny's power; and you can always build a static website with R markdown, blogdown, or bookdown.

Anyway, please keep reading as it will save you time if you are an R users who 

- want to make a portfolio website to showcase your work,
- but know little about web development,
- and yet prefer designing your own interface rather than using a popular theme.

The idea is to take advantage of Shiny's user interface design tools without relying on a Shiny server. Here is [my portfolio website](https://gl-li.github.io/). It is nowhere near fancy, but is eactly what I want.

Without further ado, let's get started. We will host the website on Github pages. Follow [this instructions](https://pages.github.com/) to create a repository called `johndoe.github.io` (replace johndoe with your username) and clone the repository to your computer. 

Now let's create a new Shiny project in the cloned directory. The file structure for this project is:

![](/post/2020-04-11-build-static-website-with-r-shiny_files/create_static_website_with_shiny_file_structure.png)

We use a simple `ui.R` as an example, which contains a picture (`birds.png`), some text (`birds.Rmd`) an internal link to a section in the same page, an external link to [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) and a link to `sample.html` in subdirectory `/samples`. For the link to `sample.html`, we will use the true url at your website: `href = "https://johndoe.github.io/samples/sample.html"`. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
ui <- fluidPage(
    sidebarLayout(
        sidebarPanel(
            width = 3,
            h2("My Static website"),
            h3("Internal link example"),
            a(h4("Birds"),
              href = "#birds"),
            hr(),
            h3("External link example"),
            a(h4("Wikipedia"),
              href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page",
              target = "blank")
        ),
        
        mainPanel(
            width = 9,
            h2("Link to a saved sample.html"),
            p("The url is https://johndoe.github.io/samples/sample.html"),
            a(h3("Lovely Birds"),
              href = "https://johndoe.github.io/samples/sample.html",
              target = "blank"),
            hr(),
            h2("Text and image example", id = "birds"),
            fluidRow(
                column(
                    7,
                    includeMarkdown("markdown/birds.Rmd")
                ),
                column(
                    5,
                    img(src = "birds.png", width = "100%")
                )
            ),
        )
    )
)
```

The `serve.R` file contains an empty function as we do not have any interactive features in `ui.R`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
server <- function(input, output) {
    # empty
}
```

With all the files in place, follow these steps to create the static website on github page.

**Step 1**: Run the Shiny app in RStudio and then open it in browser. The webpage is at localhost `127.0.0.1:6230` (may differ from yours) and looks like:

![](/post/2020-04-11-build-static-website-with-r-shiny_files/website_screen_shot.png)

**Step 2**: Save this webpage as `index.html` under directory `johndoe.github.io` as complete html. An subdirectory `index_files` contains associated files is created automatically.

**Step 3**: Open `index.html` in a text editor.

- delete all `<script> xxxx </script>`

- replace all `https://127.0.0.1:6230` with `https://johndoe.github.io`

**Step 4**: Push all files to the Github repository. Wait for a couple of minutes and your website is ready to visit at https:<span></span>//johndoe.github.io.

Find all the files [here](https://github.com/GL-Li/johndoe.github.io) and remember to change "johndoe" to your Github account username.
