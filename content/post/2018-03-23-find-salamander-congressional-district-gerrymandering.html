<p>When Republicans or Demecrats are in charge, they tend to draw election disctrict boundaries to their favor. This can go very ugly, creating crazy boundaries by a practice called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering">Gerrymandering</a>.</p>
<p>The word “Gerrymander” is a combination of two species: the Massachusetts Governer Elbridge Gerry and a mythological salamander, a dragon-like monster. Governer Gerry signed a bill 200 year ago that drew an state senate election district in a shape resembling a salamander.</p>
<p>Nobody has seen the mythological salamander, but we are quite familiar with the amphibian salamander, which also has a dragon-like shape.</p>
<p>One of my favorate Gerrymanderring example is the 6th congressional district of Pansylvania (115th congress). It has a shape vividly like a salamander.</p>

<p>We can visualize the gerrymandering easily with <code>ggtiger</code> package. The figure below shows a few congressional districts near Philadelpia in Pennsylvania for 115th Congress, including the 6th distric above and the (in)famous 7th congressional district.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># install ggtiger package from https://github.com/GL-Li/ggtiger
# devtools::install_github(&quot;GL-Li/ggtiger&quot;)
library(ggtiger)
library(viridis)

# download map near philly in PA
philly &lt;- get_map(&quot;pottstown, PA,  usa&quot;, zoom = 9, color = &quot;bw&quot;)

<p>We can do this for any locations.</p>
