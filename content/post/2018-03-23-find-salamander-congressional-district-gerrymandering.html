<p>When Republicans or Democrats are in charge, they tend to draw election district boundaries to their favor. This can go very ugly, creating wacky boundaries by a practice called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering">Gerrymandering</a>.</p>
<p>The word “Gerrymander” is a blend of two species: the Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry and a mythological salamander, a dragon-like monster. Governor Gerry signed a bill 200 year ago that drew an state senate election district in a shape resembling a salamander.</p>
<p>Nobody has seen the mythological salamander, but we are quite familiar with the amphibian salamander, which also has a dragon-like shape.</p>
<p>One of my favorite Gerrymandering example is the 6th congressional district of Pennsylvania (115th congress). Check the picture below; you will find two salamanders.</p>

<p>We can visualize the Gerrymandering easily with <code>ggtiger</code> package in R. The figure below shows a few congressional districts near Philadelphia in Pennsylvania for 115th Congress, including the 6th district above and the (in)famous 7th congressional district.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># install ggtiger package from https://github.com/GL-Li/ggtiger
# devtools::install_github(&quot;GL-Li/ggtiger&quot;)
library(ggtiger)
library(viridis)

# download map near philly in PA
philly &lt;- get_map(&quot;pottstown, PA,  usa&quot;, zoom = 9, color = &quot;bw&quot;)

### congressional district boudaries
ggmap(philly) +
    geom_boundary(&quot;congressional district&quot;, states = &quot;PA&quot;,
                  mapping = aes(fill = ..GEOID..),
                  alpha = 0.6, color = &quot;red&quot;, size = 0.3) +
    scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE)</code></pre>

<p>We can do this for any locations, for example Texas. Did you see a salamander with a long tail?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tx &lt;- get_map(&quot;san antonio, texas, usa&quot;, zoom = 8, color = &quot;bw&quot;)
ggmap(tx) +
    geom_boundary(&quot;congressional district&quot;,
                  mapping = aes(fill = ..GEOID..),
                  alpha = 0.6, color = &quot;red&quot;, size = 0.3) +
    scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE)</code></pre>
