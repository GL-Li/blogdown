This is GL Li's personal website. I love to dig into census data with R to find interesting numbers and apply the data to political, social and economic problems. A main focus of this site is to discuss how to process census data with R, in particular, using the [totalcensus package](https://github.com/GL-Li/totalcensus) I am developing. As a lifelong learner, I also like to share skills and tricks I have learned about R.
