      <title>Using totalcensus package to determine relationship between census geographic entities</title>

      <description>This is an application example of totalcensus package.
The geographic hierarchy primer in Census 2010 summary file 1 technical documentation displays the relationship between geographic entities. The lower one of the two entities connected by a line is entirely within the boundary of the upper one. For example, a county subdivision is always within the boundaries of a county and a school district always within the boundaries of a state. If two entities are not connected, they may not belong to each other.</description>

      <title>Proccess 5-digit ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA5) data with totalcensus package</title>

      <description>This is an example of more complicated applications of totalcensus package. To install the package, follow the instructions at https://github.com/GL-Li/totalcensus.
In this example, we examine data related to 5-digit ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA5), using 2016 ACS 5-year survey summary files. Let’s first load the libraries and then answer a couple questions related to zip code
library(totalcensus) library(data.table) library(magrittr) library(ggplot2) library(ggmap) What’s the population in a ZCTA5 There are 32898 ZCTA5s in the United States and a ZCTA5 has an average population of 9656 and a median population of 2780.</description>

      <description>A R user can benefit a lot from building packages. You don’t have to a be R developer to write packages. Developers write packages for others; you can just write packages for yourself. As a R user, you must have written functions and collected datasets, and you may use them across projects or you may want to use them later on. The conventional way to reuse functions is to copy and paste them to the new project or to load them by source(xxx.</description>

      <title>Extract US Census 2010 data with data.table and dplyr</title>
      <link>/2017/08/29/process-2010-census-data-with-data-table/</link>

      <description>This post explains how to extract information from the original dataset of the US 2010 census summary file 1 with urban/rural update, using data.table or dplyr package in R.
Why do we want to work with the original data? You may ask, when there are already R packages, such as UScensus2010, censusapi, and tidycensus, which help user get the data.
The biggest benefit is that you will have full access to all the census 2010 data.</description>

      <title>ggplot2: place text at right location</title>

      <description>A common tast in plotting is adding texts as labels or annotations to specific locations. ggplot() has functions geom_text(), geom_label() and annotate() for this purpose. In this post we discuss how ggplot2 controls positioning of text.
First we need to specify (x, y) coordinate in the plot to where the text is placed. As shown in the following example, the actual positioning of the text is sometimes not what you want.</description>

      <description>Default grouping in ggplot2 ggplot2 can subset all data into groups and give each group its own appearance or transformation. In many cases new users are not aware that default groups have been created, and are surprised to see the unwanted plot.
There are two ways in which groups are created implicitly:
 If x or y are categorical variables, the rows of date with the same level form a group.</description>

      <title>A uniform way to use ggplot2</title>

      <description>Just finished reading Hadley Wickman’s ggplot2 book, (second eition). Before that I have been using ggplot2 for a couple of years, mainly learned by reading documentation and searching for help online. This package is a powerful and comprehensive tool for generating static plots.
But I also feel that ggplot2 is a little bit too flexible; the same plot can be made with many different ways. This fexibility provides obvious convenience but also introduces a lot of confusion and extra burden of memorization.</description>

      <title>Compare data.table pipes and magrittr pipes</title>
      <link>/2017/07/25/improve-data-table-readability-with-pipes/</link>

      <guid>/2017/07/25/improve-data-table-readability-with-pipes/</guid>
      <description>There are two ways to chain data.table operation, using data.table pipes or using magrittr pipes. For a data.table dt, the data.table pipes take the form of dt[][][]... and magrittr pipes dt %&amp;gt;% .[] %&amp;gt;% .[] %&amp;gt;% ....
Below is an example that compares their readability. The readability of data.table pipes has been criticized in this stackoverflow post. It seems, however, not that hard to follow for those who have basic knowledge of data.</description>

      <description>This is GL Li&amp;rsquo;s personal website. I love to dig into census data with R to find interesting numbers most people do not know and apply the data to political, social and economic problems. A main focus of this site is to discuss how to process census data with R, in particular, using the totalcensus package I am developing. As a lifelong learner, I also like to share skills and tricks I have learned about R.</description>

      <description>Fatal police shooting in the United States Black people are more likely to be killed by police in blue states than in red states In large urban areas, black people are 1.96 time as likely to be fatally shot by police as non-black people in red states while it is 3.00 times in blue states. For those unarmed victims, the disparity is 3.02 in red states and as high as 4.</description>
