<h2>How to make the map</h2>
<p>Population in the United States grew by 3.76% from 313.91 million in 2012 to 325.72 million in 2017. The growth, however, is not uniform geographically. One of the geographical areas of particular interest is the city. Some cities are shrinking in population while some others exploding. The purpose of this post is to find cities that decrease and increase most in population. In addition, we will show the population and its change of all cities in an interactive map.</p>
<p>We will use population data of cities published in the American Community Survey 5-year estimates. The numbers are 5-year rolling average, for example, the data published in 2017 are averaged over the 5 year period of 2013 - 2017. ACS 1-year estimates provide data of one particular year but unfortunately they only cover cities with population greater than 65000.</p>
<div id="read-data-from-summary-files" class="section level3">
<h3>Read data from summary files</h3>
<p>In ACS data, city is presented by summary level “place”. The summary level “place” also includes census designated places (CDPs), which strictly speaking are not cities. So we will select only those places that have “city” in their names. We will also keep cities with population greater than 5000 in the 2008-2012 or 2013-2017 ACS 5-year estimates.
Let’s get the population data of cities using <code>totalcensus</code> package. The codes below read 2012 and 2017 ACS 5-year population data of all places, join the data, and calculate the percentage change in population from 2012 to 2017.</p>
