      <description>Just finished reading Hadley Wickmanâ€™s ggplot2 book, (second eition). Before that I have been using ggplot2 for a couple of years, mainly learned by reading documentation and searching for help online. This package is a powerful and comprehensive tool for generating static plots.
But I also feel that ggplot2 is a little bit too flexible; the same plot can be made with many different ways. This fexibility provides obvious convenience but also introduces a lot of confusion and extra burden of memorization.</description>
