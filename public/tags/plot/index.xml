      <description>A common tast in plotting is adding texts as labels or annotations to specific locations. ggplot() has functions geom_text(), geom_label() and annotate() for this purpose. In this post we discuss how ggplot2 controls positioning of text.
First we need to specify (x, y) coordinate in the plot to where the text is placed. As shown in the following example, the actual positioning of the text is sometimes not what you want.</description>

      <description>Default grouping in ggplot2 ggplot2 can subset all data into groups and give each group its own appearance or transformation. In many cases new users are not aware that default groups have been created, and are surprised to see the unwanted plot.
There are two ways in which groups are created implicitly:
 If x or y are categorical variables, the rows of date with the same level form a group.</description>

      <description>Just finished reading Hadley Wickmanâ€™s ggplot2 book, (second eition). Before that I have been using ggplot2 for a couple of years, mainly learned by reading documentation and searching for help online. This package is a powerful and comprehensive tool for generating static plots.
But I also feel that ggplot2 is a little bit too flexible; the same plot can be made with many different ways. This fexibility provides obvious convenience but also introduces a lot of confusion and extra burden of memorization.</description>
