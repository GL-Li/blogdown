      <description>Pie chart has been criticized for being a poor visualization and is not recommended in R community. The popular ggplot2 package discourages the use of pie charts and there is no dedicated geom_pie for it.
Although the criticism is mostly valid, there is a case that pie chart can be useful: pie charts on maps. Pie charting on map is a compact way to show composition by locations.
A recent R package, scatterpie by Guangchuang Yu, specializes in making pie charts at multiple locations.</description>
