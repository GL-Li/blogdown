      <description>A R user can benefit a lot from building packages. I have read people writing about the benefit in various occasions and cannot agree more after building my first package. We donâ€™t have to a be R developer to write packages. Developers write packages for others; we can just write packages for ourselves. As a R user, we must have written functions and collected datasets, and may have used them across projects or may want to use them later on.</description>
