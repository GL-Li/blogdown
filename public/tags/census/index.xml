      <description>Benford’s law attracted lots of attention after the 2020 election, as some people attempted to use this law to question the integrity of the election. Benford’s law states that the frequency of the first digit of a large set of numerical data follows this rule: 30.1% are 1s, 17.6% are 2s, 12.5% are 3s, …, 4.6% are 9s. Therefore it can be used to detect data manipulation that leads to the violaton of the law.</description>

      <description>Population in the United States grew by 3.76% from 313.91 million in 2012 to 325.72 million in 2017. The growth, however, is not uniform geographically. One of the geographical areas of particular interest is the city. Some cities are shrinking in population while some others exploding. The purpose of this post is to find cities that decrease and increase most in population. In addition, we will show the population and its change of all cities in an interactive map.</description>

      <title>Find Salamander -- Congressional District Gerrymandering</title>

      <description>When Republicans or Democrats are in charge, they tend to draw election district boundaries to their favor. This can go very ugly, creating wacky boundaries by a practice called Gerrymandering.
The word “Gerrymander” is a blend of two species: the Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry and a mythological salamander, a dragon-like monster. Governor Gerry signed a bill 200 year ago that drew an state senate election district in a shape resembling a salamander.</description>

      <description>Despite 1 in every 110 adults are locked behind bars in the United States, most people have no idea where these prisons are. This post helps you find out the location and number of inmates in federal prisons, state prisons, and local jails.
The data are extracted from Decennial Census 2010. According to the census, a total number of 2,263,602 persons were incarcerated in the United States.</description>

      <title>Is your hometown named after Lincoln or Washington?</title>
      <link>/2018/01/27/the-most-popular-president-lincoln-or-washington/</link>

      <description>Washington and Lincoln are the two greatest presidents in the history of the United States. This post, however, does not discuss how great they are. Instead, I want to show a fun fact related the two presidents: how many cities and towns (and equivalents) are named after them. I am living in Lincoln, Rhode Island, a town so named in honor of President Lincoln.
The data are extracted from decennial census 2010, the most detailed census so far.</description>

      <title>Determine relationship between census geographic entities with totalcensus package</title>
      <link>/2017/12/28/use-totalcensus-package-to-determine-relationship-between-geographic-entities/</link>

      <guid>/2017/12/28/use-totalcensus-package-to-determine-relationship-between-geographic-entities/</guid>
      <description>This is an application example of totalcensus package.
The geographic hierarchy primer in Census 2010 summary file 1 technical documentation displays the relationship between geographic entities. The lower one of the two entities connected by a line is entirely within the boundary of the upper one. For example, a county subdivision is always within the boundaries of a county and a school district always within the boundaries of a state.</description>
