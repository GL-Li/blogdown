      <description>This is an application example of totalcensus package.
The geographic hierarchy primer in Census 2010 summary file 1 technical documentation displays the relationship between geographic entities. The lower one of the two entities connected by a line is entirely within the boundary of the upper one. For example, a county subdivision is always within the boundaries of a county and a school district always within the boundaries of a state. If two entities are not connected, they may not belong to each other.</description>

      <description>This is an example of more complicated applications of totalcensus package. To install the package, follow the instructions at https://github.com/GL-Li/totalcensus.
In this example, we examine data related to 5-digit ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA5), using 2016 ACS 5-year survey summary files. Let’s first load the libraries and then answer a couple questions related to zip code
library(totalcensus) library(data.table) library(magrittr) library(ggplot2) library(ggmap) What’s the population in a ZCTA5 There are 32898 ZCTA5s in the United States and a ZCTA5 has an average population of 9656 and a median population of 2780.</description>
