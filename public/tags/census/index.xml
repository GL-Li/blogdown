&lt;p&gt;With the newly added data, the &lt;code&gt;totalcensus&lt;/code&gt; package now is able to extract data from summary files of decennial census 2000 and 2010, ACS (American Community Survey) 1 year estimates from 2005 to 2017, and ACS 5 year estimates with ending year from 2009 to 2017. With this capacity we can easily look into how things change over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post I will show how to extract population of all cities in 2012 and 2017 and compare the changes in population. We will use ACS 5 year estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Find Salamander -- Congressional District Gerrymandering</title>
      <link>/2018/03/23/find-salamander-congressional-district-gerrymandering/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 23 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2018/03/23/find-salamander-congressional-district-gerrymandering/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When Republicans or Democrats are in charge, they tend to draw election district boundaries to their favor. This can go very ugly, creating wacky boundaries by a practice called &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering&#34;&gt;Gerrymandering&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word “Gerrymander” is a blend of two species: the Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry and a mythological salamander, a dragon-like monster. Governor Gerry signed a bill 200 year ago that drew an state senate election district in a shape resembling a salamander.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody has seen the mythological salamander, but we are quite familiar with the amphibian salamander, which also has a dragon-like shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite Gerrymandering example is the 6th congressional district of Pennsylvania (115th congress). Check the picture below; you will find two salamanders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;img/PA_6th_congress_distric.png&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can visualize the Gerrymandering easily with &lt;code&gt;ggtiger&lt;/code&gt; package in R. The figure below shows a few congressional districts near Philadelphia in Pennsylvania for 115th Congress, including the 6th district above and the (in)famous 7th congressional district.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# install ggtiger package from https://github.com/GL-Li/ggtiger
# devtools::install_github(&amp;quot;GL-Li/ggtiger&amp;quot;)
library(ggtiger)
library(viridis)

# download map near philly in PA
philly &amp;lt;- get_map(&amp;quot;pottstown, PA,  usa&amp;quot;, zoom = 9, color = &amp;quot;bw&amp;quot;)

### congressional district boudaries
ggmap(philly) +
    geom_boundary(&amp;quot;congressional district&amp;quot;, states = &amp;quot;PA&amp;quot;,
                  mapping = aes(fill = ..GEOID..),
                  alpha = 0.6, color = &amp;quot;red&amp;quot;, size = 0.3) +
    scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../../post/2018-03-23-find-salamander-congressional-district-gerrymandering_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can do this for any locations, for example Texas. Did you see a salamander with a long tail?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;tx &amp;lt;- get_map(&amp;quot;san antonio, texas, usa&amp;quot;, zoom = 8, color = &amp;quot;bw&amp;quot;)
ggmap(tx) +
    geom_boundary(&amp;quot;congressional district&amp;quot;,
                  mapping = aes(fill = ..GEOID..),
                  alpha = 0.6, color = &amp;quot;red&amp;quot;, size = 0.3) +
    scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../../post/2018-03-23-find-salamander-congressional-district-gerrymandering_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite 1 in every 110 adults are locked behind bars, most ordenary people have no idea where are these prisons. This post helps you find out the location of and number of inmates in federal prisons, state prisons, and local jails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data are extracted from Census 2010. According to the census, a total number of 2,263,602 persons were incarcerated in the United States. Among them, 172,020 were in federal prisons, 1,248,167 in state prisons, and 682,043 in local jails. In addition to the total number, Census 2010 also provides the number of inmates in small areas down to census tract and county subdivision. With the small area data, we can map them on interactive maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/GL-Li/totalcensus&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;totalcensus&lt;/code&gt; package&lt;/a&gt; to extract prison data with spatial resolution at county subdivision level and use &lt;code&gt;leaflet&lt;/code&gt; package to make interactive map. Drag, zoom in and click on each data point to find more information about a prison.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is your hometown named after Lincoln or Washington?</title>
      <link>/2018/01/27/the-most-popular-president-lincoln-or-washington/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 27 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2018/01/27/the-most-popular-president-lincoln-or-washington/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Washington and Lincoln are the two greatest presidents in the history of the United States. This post, however, does not discuss how great they are. Instead, I want to show a fun fact related the two presidents: how many cities and towns (and equivalents) are named after them. I am living in Lincoln, Rhode Island, a town so named in honor of President Lincoln.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data are extracted from decennial census 2010, the most detailed census so far. There are 311 cities and towns having “Washington” in their names and 205 having “Lincoln”. We also extract the coordinates and population of these cities and towns and plot them on the US map. There are significantly more places named after “Washington” than “Lincoln” in three states, Indiana , Ohio, and Pennsylvania. They combined have 109 more places with &lt;code&gt;Washington&lt;/code&gt; than with &lt;code&gt;Lincoln&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../../post/2018-01-23-the-most-popular-president-lincoln-or-washington_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png&#34; width=&#34;864&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../../post/2018-01-23-the-most-popular-president-lincoln-or-washington_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png&#34; width=&#34;816&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the code. We use package &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/GL-Li/totalcensus&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;totalcensus&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to extract data from decennial census 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s first load packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(totalcensus)
library(data.table)
library(magrittr)
library(ggmap)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Define a function to extract census data of cities and towns including particular words in names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;get_area &amp;lt;- function(keywords){
    # read census data
    selected &amp;lt;- read_decennial(
        year = 2010,
        states = &amp;quot;US&amp;quot;,
        geo_headers = c(&amp;quot;NAME&amp;quot;),
        show_progress = FALSE
    ) %&amp;gt;%
        # select place and county subdivision that have name in NAME
        .[SUMLEV %in% c(&amp;quot;060&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;160&amp;quot;)] %&amp;gt;%
        .[NAME %like% paste0(keywords, collapse = &amp;quot;|&amp;quot;)] %&amp;gt;%
        # remove duplicates by (lon, lat)
        unique(by = c(&amp;quot;lon&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;lat&amp;quot;))
    
    # add area column to store keywords of area
    for (nm in keywords){
        selected[NAME %like% nm, area := nm]
    }
    
    return(selected)
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cities or town having words “Washington” or “Lincoln” in their names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wl &amp;lt;- get_area(c(&amp;quot;Washington&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Lincoln&amp;quot;)) %&amp;gt;%
    .[, area := factor(area, c(&amp;quot;Washington&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Lincoln&amp;quot;))]

      <title>Determine relationship between census geographic entities with totalcensus package</title>
      <link>/2017/12/28/use-totalcensus-package-to-determine-relationship-between-geographic-entities/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 28 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2017/12/28/use-totalcensus-package-to-determine-relationship-between-geographic-entities/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is an application example of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/GL-Li/totalcensus&#34;&gt;totalcensus package&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The geographic hierarchy primer in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/doc/sf1.pdf&#34;&gt;Census 2010 summary file 1 technical documentation&lt;/a&gt; displays the relationship between geographic entities. The lower one of the two entities connected by a line is entirely within the boundary of the upper one. For example, a county subdivision is always within the boundaries of a county and a school district always within the boundaries of a state. If two entities are not connected, they may not belong to each other. For example, the ZIP code tabulation areas may cross state borders though they are much smaller than states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;https://s3.amazonaws.com/gl-shared-pictures/hierarchy_census_geographic_entities.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is easy to get the summary statistics of lower geographies within a higher one when they are connected. For example, if we want the race population of all county subdivision in Kent county, RI, we can run&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If two geographic entities are not connected by a line, how do we know, for example, how many ZIP code tabulation areas are in or partially in Boston city?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to answer this question is that census blocks are connected to and lower than all other geographies. We can connect any two geographic entities through census blocks: if an ZIP code tabulation area and Boston city share a census block, the ZIP code is in or partially in the city. The decennial census 2010 has data down to block level, with which we can find all zip codes in Boston using &lt;code&gt;totalcensus&lt;/code&gt; package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;zip_boston &amp;lt;- read_decennial(
    year = 2010,
    states = &amp;quot;MA&amp;quot;,
    geo_headers = c(&amp;quot;ZCTA5&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;PLACE&amp;quot;),
    summary_level = &amp;quot;block&amp;quot;
) %&amp;gt;%
    # use search_fips(&amp;quot;boston&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;MA&amp;quot;) to find its PLACE code is &amp;quot;07000&amp;quot;
    .[PLACE == &amp;quot;07000&amp;quot;, unique(ZCTA5)]

    # [33] &amp;quot;02152&amp;quot; &amp;quot;02151&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s read race population by zip code in or partially in Boston city from the latest 2016 ACS 5-year survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# read data for all zip code
race_zip_boston &amp;lt;- read_acs5year(
    year = 2016,
    states = &amp;quot;US&amp;quot;,   # ZCTA5 only in national files
    geo_headers = &amp;quot;ZCTA5&amp;quot;,
    table_contents = c(
        &amp;quot;white = B02001_002&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;black = B02001_003&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;asian = B02001_005&amp;quot;
    ),
    summary_level = &amp;quot;860&amp;quot;  # of ZCTA5
) %&amp;gt;%
    # select zip codes in or partially in Boston city
    .[ZCTA5 %in% zip_boston]

head(race_zip_boston, 3)
     #           GEOID       lon      lat ZCTA5 state population white black asian GEOCOMP SUMLEV        NAME
     # 1: 86000US02108 -71.06485 42.35777 02108    NA       4049  3515   209   172     all    860 ZCTA5 02108
     # 2: 86000US02109 -71.05063 42.36722 02109    NA       4015  3497   135   249     all    860 ZCTA5 02109

&lt;p&gt;Let’s examine another example: congressional districts (CD for 111th congress) and state legislative districts (SLDU for Upper Chamber year 1 and SLDL for Lower Chamber year 1). Both CD and SLDs descend from states but do not belong to each other. Usually SLDs are smaller than CD. So which SLDs are in or partially in each CD? Again, we can connect CD and SLD with census blocks using decennial census 2010 data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;vote_RI &amp;lt;- read_decennial(
    year = 2010,
    states = &amp;quot;RI&amp;quot;,
    geo_headers = c(&amp;quot;CD&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;SLDU&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;SLDL&amp;quot;),
    summary_level = &amp;quot;block&amp;quot;
) %&amp;gt;%
    .[, .(SLDU = list(unique(SLDU)), SLDL = list(unique(SLDL))), by = CD] 

# each CD contains a vector of SLDUs and a vector of SLDLs
    #    CD                             SLDU                             SLDL

      <title>Proccess 5-digit ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA5) data with totalcensus package</title>
      <link>/2017/12/23/census_data_zip_code/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 23 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2017/12/23/census_data_zip_code/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is an example of applications of &lt;code&gt;totalcensus&lt;/code&gt; package. To install the package, follow the instructions at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/GL-Li/totalcensus&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;https://github.com/GL-Li/totalcensus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, we examine data related to 5-digit ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA5), using 2016 ACS 5-year survey summary files. Let’s first load the libraries and then answer a couple questions related to zip code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(totalcensus)
library(data.table)
library(magrittr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggmap)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;whats-the-population-in-a-zcta5&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s the population in a ZCTA5&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These population data can be easily obtained with the code below. There are 32898 ZCTA5s in the United States and a ZCTA5 has an average population of 9656 and a median population of 2780. The population distribution is highly skewed towards zero with 320 of them having no people living in and 1583 having population below 100. There are 252 zip code having population over 65000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# read population in each zip code
zip_population &amp;lt;- read_acs5year(
    year = 2016,
    states = &amp;quot;US&amp;quot;,
    geo_headers = &amp;quot;ZCTA5&amp;quot;,
    summary_level = &amp;quot;860&amp;quot;
)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## 
## Reading US 2016 ACS 5-year survey geography file&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;summary(zip_population$population)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##       0     714    2780    9656   13040  115104&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;median-age-in-a-zcta5&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Median age in a ZCTA5&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just for fun, let’s find out the median age of population living in each ZCTA5. The result is pretty interesting. After removing those ZCTA5s with population below 1000 and those with larger margin of error in median age estimate and population count, the smallest median age of a ZCTA5 is 19 and largest is 75.50. These numbers mean that some zip code tabulation area are dominated by very young people while some are dominated by very old people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# read median age 
median_age &amp;lt;- read_acs5year(
    year = 2016,
    states = &amp;quot;US&amp;quot;,
    table_contents = &amp;quot;median_age = B01002_001&amp;quot;,
    geo_headers = &amp;quot;ZCTA5&amp;quot;,
    summary_level = &amp;quot;860&amp;quot;,
    with_margin = TRUE
) %&amp;gt;%
    # only keep good age estimate and population count
    .[median_age_margin &amp;lt; 0.1 * median_age] %&amp;gt;%
    .[population_margin &amp;lt; 0.1 * population] %&amp;gt;%
    # remove ZCTA5 with population below 1000
    .[population &amp;gt; 1000]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## 
## Reading US 2016 ACS 5-year survey geography file&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;summary(median_age$median_age)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##   19.00   35.60   39.90   39.89   43.90   75.50&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How are these extreme median ages possible for a zip code area which has thousands population? The young median age is easier to understand - many colleges are assigned exclusively with a zip code and the residents in this zip are mostly students living in dorms so the median age can be very low. The zip code areas with very old median age, though a surprise, are still understandable: these are the communities full of retired people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is said that people like to go to South for warm weather after retirement. Can we see this from the median age data? Yes, old people went Florida!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# download US map
us_map &amp;lt;- get_map(&amp;quot;US&amp;quot;, zoom = 4, color = &amp;quot;bw&amp;quot;)

# plot ZCTA5 with 65 or up median age on map
ggmap(us_map) + 
    geom_point(data = median_age[median_age &amp;gt; 65], 
               aes(lon, lat, size = population),
               color = &amp;quot;red&amp;quot;,
               alpha = 0.5) +
    ylim(25, 50) +
    scale_size_area(max_size = 3) +
    labs(
        title = &amp;quot;ZIP code area with median age above 65&amp;quot;,
        caption = &amp;quot;Source: 2016 ACS 5-year survey&amp;quot;,
        x = NULL,
        y = NULL
    ) +
    theme(
        axis.text = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank()
    )&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
