      <description>This is an application example of totalcensus package.
The geographic hierarchy primer in Census 2010 summary file 1 technical documentation displays the relationship between geographic entities. The lower one of the two entities connected by a line is entirely within the boundary of the upper one. For example, a county subdivision is always within the boundaries of a county and a school district always within the boundaries of a state. If two entities are not connected, they may not belong to each other.</description>

      <description>This is an example of more complicated applications of totalcensus package. To install the package, follow the instructions at https://github.com/GL-Li/totalcensus.
In this example, we examine data related to 5-digit ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA5), using 2016 ACS 5-year survey summary files. Let’s first load the libraries and then answer a couple questions related to zip code
library(totalcensus) library(data.table) library(magrittr) library(ggplot2) library(ggmap) What’s the population in a ZCTA5 There are 32898 ZCTA5s in the United States and a ZCTA5 has an average population of 9656 and a median population of 2780.</description>

      <description>A R user can benefit a lot from building packages. You don’t have to a be R developer to write packages. Developers write packages for others; you can just write packages for yourself. As a R user, you must have written functions and collected datasets, and you may use them across projects or you may want to use them later on. The conventional way to reuse functions is to copy and paste them to the new project or to load them by source(xxx.</description>
